# First Sprint

The purpose of the first sprint was to create a bangazon api. This api allows access to the company's inventory/internal database.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of our API up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this api, you will need to install three gems: ```gem 'rails', '~> 5.1.4'```, ```gem 'sqlite3'```, and ```gem 'rack-cors', '>= 1.0.2'```. 


### Installing

How to run the api:
1. ```Git clone``` the repo.
1. ```CD``` into the newly cloned directory.
1. Run ```bundle install```.
1. Run ```rails db:migrate```.
1. Run ```rails server```.
1. Go to schema.rb and find path to add dummy data (this should be appended to the localhost url - ex: localhost:3000/orders).
