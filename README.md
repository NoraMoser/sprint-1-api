# First Sprint

The purpose of the first sprint was to create a bangazon api. This api allows access to the company's inventory/internal database.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of our API up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this api, you will need three gems: ```gem 'rails', '~> 5.1.4'```, ```gem 'sqlite3'```, and ```gem 'rack-cors', '>= 1.0.2'```. 
These will be installed once you run bundle install.

* For windows users, you will need to install an additional gem: ```gem 'wdm', '>= 0.1.0'```

### Installing

How to run the api:
1.Fork the repo.
1.Open it in terminal and CD into the directory
1.Clone repo
1.Run bundle install.
1.Run rails db:migrate.
1.Run rails server.
1.Go to schema.rb and find path to add dummy data (this should be appended to the localhost url - ex: localhost:3000/orders).
1.At this point you are on your own.
